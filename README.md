Praat Scripts for the extraction of dynamic data in speech signals

As of 2016-06, only the testing branch contains scripts. If I put them under testing,
I consider they are functionnal. They may still be buggy but you may try to use them
at your own risk.

(Please note that even the future "master" branch scripts will be used at your own risk
but I will later setup criteria for putting anything under the master branch).
